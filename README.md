The Map Editor was developed during the 5th week of the Code For All Bootcamp.

We utilized the 'Simple Graphic Library' provided by the program. 

The project involved creating a paint application with a grid interface. 

Users could move the pointer in any direction to paint or unpaint individual boxes, clear all the boxes, save their work, and load the last saved designs.
