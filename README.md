## About The Project


The Map Editor was developed during the 5th week of the Code For All Bootcamp.

We utilized the 'Simple Graphic Library' provided by the program. 

The project involved creating a paint application with a grid interface. 

Users could move the pointer in any direction to paint or unpaint individual boxes, clear all the boxes, save their work, and load the last saved designs.
### Built With

- [Java](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Java)

## Usage

Space - Paint the box. If the box is already painted, unpaint it.

C - Clear all boxes.

S - Save the current design.

L - Load a previously saved design.
